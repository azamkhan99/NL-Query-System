There are a lot of limitations in the system I have designed. This includes the fact that only questions that start with "who" or "which" can be asked or the fact that only nouns which are in the Brown corpus are accepted. Another limitation is that statements entered into the interactive dialogue must start with a proper noun. These are my two main aspects of the system I'd like to address. I don't think the question structure would be too difficult to improve. This is because the grammar rules for 'S' can be expanded to add other words to start the question-sentence.
